# AIPM Cheat-Sheet (One Pager)

**AI Lifecycle Stages:** problem framing → data → modeling → evaluation → deployment → monitoring → iteration

**Core Metrics:** precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC (with 1–2 line definitions)

**Responsible AI Checkpoints:** fairness, transparency, privacy, security, human oversight

**Quick Formulas:** 
- F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
- ICE score = (Impact * Confidence) / Effort
